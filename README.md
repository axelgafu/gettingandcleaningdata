Execute run_Analysis.R, no parameters are required, however, that script requires Internet access.

That script will automatically perform the following actions:
1) Download the data file.  
2) Unzip the data file.  
3) Extract the required data from train and test data sets.  
4) Merge the extracted data in a file called tidyData.csv.  
5) Generate statistics for the data. Statistics are saved in averages.csv.  
6) Remove temporary files.  


See more details about the generated data in _CodeBook.md_ file.
